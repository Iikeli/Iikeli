### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love to learn and teach. I write articles on [my website](https://www.iiroalhonen.com/blog) and [on Medium](https://medium.com/@iiroalhonen).

I worked in the QA side of things for a few years and now I'm excited to get back into development full time.

#### Other info
In my free time I like to go bouldering, play video games, and read books and comics.
I'm also running my first D&D campaing (I'm also the DM ðŸ˜±).
