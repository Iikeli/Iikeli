### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![Picture of me](https://res.cloudinary.com/iiroalhonen/image/upload/c_scale,w_500/v1600061757/IMG_23_sml_up4wug.jpg)

I love to learn and teaching others is a great way to learn. That is why I write articles on [my website](https://www.iiroalhonen.com/blog) and [on Medium](https://medium.com/@iiroalhonen).

I'm working full time as an iOS developer with KPS Software in Bremen and publish my own apps through my company, Nifty Tree Studios. I enjoy working in the iOS and macOS ecosystems writing Swift code.

Currently working on:
- [Bean Juice](https://www.niftytreestudios.com/work/bean-juice)
- [Carefaktor](https://carefaktor.de)
- Nifty Dice Roller (package and app)
- A couple of unannounced projects

#### Other info
In my free time I like to go bouldering, play video games, and read books and comics.
I'm also a beginner dungeon master, throwing my players into Avernus.
