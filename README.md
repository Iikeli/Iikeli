### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love to learn and teach. I write articles on [my website](https://www.iiroalhonen.com/blog) and [on Medium](https://medium.com/@iiroalhonen).

I'm working full time as a software developer. I enjoy writing JavaScript, Python and Swift.

#### Other info
In my free time I like to go bouldering, play video games, and read books and comics.
I'm also running my first D&D campaing (in which, I'm the DM ðŸ˜±).
